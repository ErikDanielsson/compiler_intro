lexer.c
    Add relational operators to keyword symbol table. Create variable and
    function symbol table during lexical analysis. Inline the hash function
    in get_lexeme(), so the function only mallocates for new variable.
    Otherwise return a pointer to the value of the correct symbol table
    entry. 

parser.c:
    Implement DAG creation by putting nodes in hash table. This should
    be quite simple for expressions since they are made of simple constructs
    with straightforward hash calculation, but harder for things such as
    statements since the hash calculation is more complicated. Doing this
    does, however, have many advantages in both in terms of performance
    (fewer mallocs) and optimization of intermediate representation with
    things such as pre-calculation of expressions and generating fewer
    assembly lines.
