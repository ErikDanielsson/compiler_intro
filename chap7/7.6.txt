Exercise 7.6.1: Show the steps of a mark-and-sweep garbage collector on
a) Fig. 7.19 with the pointer A -t B deleted.
b) Fig. 7. 19 with the pointer A -+ C deleted.
c) Fig. 7.20 with the pointer A -+ D deleted.
d) Fig. 7.20 with the object B deleted.
Exercise 7.6.2: The Baker mark-and-sweep algorithm moves objects among
four lists: Free, Unreached, Unscanned, and Scanned. For each of the object
networks of Exercise 7.6.1, indicate for each object the sequence of lists on
which it finds itself from just before garbage collection begins until just after it
finishes.
Exercise 7.6.3: Suppose we perform a mark-and-compact garbage collection
on each of the networks of Exercise 7.6.1. Also, suppose that
i. Each object has size 100 bytes, and
ii. Initially, the nine objects in the heap are arranged in alphabetical order,
starting at byte 0 of the heap.
What is the address of each object after garbage collection?

Exercise 7.6.4 : Suppose we execute Cheney's copying garbage collection al­
gorithm on each of the networks of Exercise 7.6.1. Also, suppose that
    i.Each object has size 100 bytes,
    ii. The unscanned list is managed as a queue, and when an object has more
    than one pointer, the reached objects are added to the queue in alpha­betical
    order, and
    iii. The From semispace starts at location 0, and the To semispace starts at
    location 10,000.
What is the value of NewLocation(o) for each object 0 that remains after garbage
collection?
