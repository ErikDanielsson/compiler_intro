Exercise 7.3.1: In Fig. 7.15 is a ML function main that computes Fibonacci
numbers in a nonstandard way. Function fib0 will compute the nth Fibonacci
number for any n >= O. Nested within in is fib1, which computes the nth
Fibonacci number on the assumption n >= 2, and nested within fib1 is fib2,
which assumes n >= 4. Note that neither fib1 nor fib2 need to check for the
basis cases. Show the stack of activation records that result from a call to main,
up until the time that the first call (to fib0(1) ) is about to return. Show the
access link in each of the activation records on the stack.

    ----
0   main
    NULL
    ----
1   fib0
    0
    ----
2   fib1
    1
    ----
3   fib2
    2
    ----
4   fib1
    1
    ----
5   fib0
    0
    ----
6   fib1
    5
    ----
7   fib0
    0

Exercise 7.3.2: Suppose that we implement the functions of Fig. 7. 15 using
a display. Show the display at the moment the first call to fib0(1) is about to
return. Also, indicate the saved display entry in each of the activation records
on the stack at that time.

d[1] = 0
d[2] = 7
d[3] = 6
d[4] = 3

    ----
0   main
    NULL
    ----
1   fib0
    NULL
    ----
2   fib1
    NULL
    ----
3   fib2
    NULL
    ----
4   fib1
